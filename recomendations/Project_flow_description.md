## Main Query Processing Flow with Persistent Retriever Architecture

### 1. Request Reception and Observability (Production-Ready)
- User submits a query through the frontend (Streamlit)
- **Request Tracing**: Distributed tracing begins with unique trace ID
- **Observability**: Prometheus metrics capture request start time
- The query is sent to the FastAPI backend via `/api/chat` endpoint
- **Environment-Aware Processing**: Configuration adapts based on environment (dev/staging/prod)
- **UNIFIED PROCESSING**: No language parameter validation needed
- Chat history is formatted from conversation messages
- **Background Logging**: Structured logging with JSON format for observability
- **Health Validation**: Automatic dependency health checks before processing

### 2. Cache Check Phase
The system implements a sophisticated two-level caching mechanism with enhanced chunk content storage:

#### 2.1 Exact Cache Match
- System generates MD5 hash of the normalized query
- Checks Redis for exact query match
- If found and not expired (24 hours TTL), returns cached response immediately
- **Fix Applied**: Cache cleanup automatically removes invalid entries

#### 2.2 Semantic Cache Match (Enhanced Logic)
- If no exact match, system generates query embedding using appropriate language model
- Compares query embedding against stored query embeddings using cosine similarity
- If similarity score >= `QUERY_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD` (default: 0.85), considers it a semantic match
- **Critical Fix**: Properly stores and retrieves full document content (`chunk_content`) instead of just filenames
- **New Behavior**: Instead of returning cached response directly:
  - If valid cached response and chunks exist: Uses cached chunks for new response generation
  - If no valid cached data: Continues with normal RAG processing

### 2.3 Semantic Cache Processing with Fixed Chunk Content Storage

#### 2.3.1 Cached Chunk Retrieval (Fixed)
- System retrieves stored document chunks from the semantically similar query
- **FIXED**: Chunks now include actual full content (`chunk_content`) instead of just filenames
- Chunks include complete metadata (source, scores, reranking scores, etc.)
- **Cache Validation**: Automatic cleanup removes entries with invalid chunk content

#### 2.3.2 Targeted Reranking with Validation
- Performs reranking using cached chunks against the NEW query
- Uses appropriate language-specific Cohere reranking model
- **Critical Validation**: Checks if any chunk achieves `reranking_score >= MIN_RERANKING_SCORE` (default: 0.2)
- **Fixed Issue**: Chunks now contain actual document text for meaningful reranking

#### 2.3.3 Adaptive Processing Decision
**If chunks are relevant after reranking (≥ MIN_RERANKING_SCORE):**
- Continues with cached chunk strategy
- Filters context to include only sufficiently relevant chunks
- Generates fresh response using validated reranked chunks with actual content
- Stores new response in Redis following standard criteria

**If no chunks are relevant after reranking:**
- **Intelligent Fallback**: Abandons cached chunk strategy
- **Automatic Recovery**: Proceeds with complete RAG processing
- Executes full document retrieval using ensemble retrievers
- Performs standard reranking on fresh documents
- Generates response with newly retrieved, relevant content

#### 2.3.4 Quality Assurance and Cache Integrity
- **Automatic Cache Cleanup**: System detects and removes entries with invalid chunk content
- **Content Validation**: Ensures chunk_content contains actual document text, not just filenames
- **Performance Tracking**: Monitors cache effectiveness and chunk content quality
- **Error Prevention**: Prevents LLM from receiving inadequate context due to missing content

### 3. Query Generation and Enhancement (Unified)
If no cache hit (exact or semantic with valid data), the system generates multiple query variations:

#### 3.1 Unified Multi-Query Generation
Using a single LLM call, the system generates:
- Original query (any language)
- Step-back query (more generic version)
- Multiple query variations for broader retrieval
- **ELIMINATED**: Language translation (no longer needed with unified processing)

#### 3.2 Unified Glossary-Aware Processing
- System checks for specialized terms in unified multilingual University of Graz glossary

- Combines definitions: "German definition | EN: English definition"

    ↓
Exact Cache Match? (Language-agnostic)
    ├─ YES → Return Cached Response
    ↓
    NO → Generate Query Embedding (Unified Azure OpenAI)
    ↓
Semantic Match Found (≥ 0.85 similarity)? (Unified embedding space)
    ├─ NO → Execute Full Unified RAG Pipeline
    ↓
    YES → Retrieve Cached Chunks
    ↓
Validate Chunk Content Integrity
    ├─ INVALID → Clean Cache + Execute Full Unified RAG Pipeline
    ↓
    VALID → Rerank Cached Chunks vs New Query (Multilingual Cohere)
    ↓
